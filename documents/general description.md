# Nav Care — General Description

Nav Care is a mobile-first platform that connects users with doctors, clinics, and hospitals. It helps people discover nearby healthcare providers, compare options, book appointments, and manage their care journey in one place.

## Mission

Make quality healthcare easier to **find**, **access**, and **manage** by unifying discovery, booking, and patient–provider communication.

## What Problems It Solves

* **Discovery friction:** Users struggle to find the right specialist, clinic, or hospital that matches their symptoms, location, budget, and insurance.
* **Fragmented booking:** Phone-based scheduling, limited hours, and missed calls lead to delays and no-shows.
* **Information gaps:** Sparse provider profiles and inconsistent availability create uncertainty and extra back-and-forth.
* **Follow-up & continuity:** Patients need a simple way to track appointments, documents, and instructions.

## High-Level Solution

* **Search & Match:** Location-aware, filterable search across doctors, clinics, and hospitals (specialty, rating, language, insurance, availability).
* **Unified Booking:** Real-time or request-based appointment scheduling with reminders and rescheduling.
* **Rich Profiles:** Standardized profiles with credentials, specialties, experience, languages, and patient ratings.
* **Care Journey Tools:** Appointment history, basic records (e.g., visit notes summaries), and secure document attachments.
* **Notifications:** Timely reminders and updates to reduce no-shows and improve adherence.

## Target Users

* **Patients & Caregivers:** Find providers, compare options, book visits, and manage follow-ups.
* **Healthcare Providers (Doctors/Clinics/Hospitals):** Publish profiles, manage schedules, and receive bookings.

## Core User Flows

1. **Discover:** User searches “cardiology” or “pediatrics,” applies filters (distance, insurance), and views ranked results.
2. **Evaluate:** User opens a provider profile to review credentials, ratings, languages, clinic location, and available slots.
3. **Book:** User selects a time, confirms details, and receives a confirmation + calendar reminder.
4. **Manage:** User views upcoming appointments, reschedules/cancels if needed, and reviews visit notes or attached files.

## Key Features (MVP+)

* Provider & facility directory (search, filters, map view)
* Provider profiles (credentials, specialties, experience, languages, ratings)
* Appointment booking (instant or request-based) with reminders
* User accounts & authentication (email/phone; optional social login)
* Multi-language support (e.g., English/Arabic/French)
* Basic records management (appointment history, attachments)
* Ratings & feedback collection (post-visit)
* Privacy controls and secure data handling

## Non-Goals (Early Stages)

* Real-time telemedicine/video calls (can be a future add-on)
* E-prescriptions and pharmacy fulfillment
* Insurance claims submission and adjudication
* Deep EHR/EMR integrations (beyond basic interoperability)

## Platforms

* **Mobile:** Flutter app (Android & iOS)
* **Backend:** RESTful API (provider directory, booking, auth)
* **Notifications:** Push + email/SMS (as permitted)

## Architecture (At a Glance)

* **Client:** Flutter app with feature-first structure, BLoC state management, and modular layers (core/data/presentation).
* **Networking:** Dio-based minimal HTTP client; unified error handling with `Result/Failure`.
* **Config:** `.env` for environment-specific endpoints (API base, sockets).
* **Routing:** `go_router`; **DI:** `get_it`; **i18n:** `easy_localization`.

## Data Model (Conceptual)

* **User:** profile, preferences, insurance info (optional), history.
* **Provider:** doctor/clinic/hospital profile, specialties, languages, ratings.
* **Availability/Slots:** time windows and bookable slots.
* **Appointment:** user ↔ provider relation, status, timestamps, notes.
* **Feedback:** ratings and short reviews.

## Privacy & Security

* **Data minimization:** Collect only what’s necessary for booking and follow-up.
* **Secure transport & storage:** Encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (per backend policy).
* **Consent & transparency:** Clear terms for data usage and sharing.
* **Compliance-aware design:** Built to support regional privacy/health regulations (e.g., GDPR-like principles); deeper certifications can come later.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

* RTL layout support (e.g., Arabic).
* High-contrast themes and scalable typography.
* Plain-language labels and error messages.

## Success Metrics

* **Discovery:** Time to find a suitable provider; search-to-profile open rate.
* **Conversion:** Profile view → booking rate; booking completion rate.
* **Retention:** Repeat bookings; canceled/no-show reduction.
* **Satisfaction:** Post-visit ratings; NPS.

## Roadmap (Illustrative)

* **MVP:** Search, profiles, booking, reminders, multi-language.
* **Phase 2:** Provider dashboards, advanced filters (insurance networks, accessibility options), improved maps.
* **Phase 3:** Secure messaging, document sharing, telehealth pilot.
* **Phase 4:** Insurance integrations, analytics for providers, advanced personalization.

**In short:** Nav Care centralizes provider discovery and appointment management into a clean, secure, multilingual experience—streamlining access to doctors, clinics, and hospitals for everyone.
